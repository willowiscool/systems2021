#+TITLE: Shell

* Features
- Run commands with arguments (duh)
- Separate multiple commands on one line with semicolons
- Pipe the output of one command to another (only two commands at a time for now)
- Redirection
* Not Yet Implemented
- Other bash builtins
* Known Bugs
- In other shells, ~>~ takes precedence over ~|~ but ~<~ does not. In this shell, ~>~ and ~<~ both take precedence over ~|~, such that running the command ~cat | cat < test~ in this shell is equivalent to running ~cat < test | cat~ in other shells.
* Copy of every function header
